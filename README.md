# About [Féminicides-infos](http://feminicides-infos.herokuapp.com)

This project was imagined based on the work of a feminist collective, created by families of women murdered by their (ex-)partners in France.
They have been documenting these events and putting up a real journalist job.
But they did not have a proper tool, so for our final bootcamp project, we decided to design one specifically tailored to their needs.

This repository contains our website's front-end.
You can find the back-end repository [here](https://github.com/myracodes/feminicides-info-express)

*Féminicides-info was created by Anaïs ENGLER, Anna LEFOUR, Mélusine REY, and Myriam MIRA*
